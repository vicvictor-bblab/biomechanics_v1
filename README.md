# Biomechanics Graph App

This repository contains a Tkinter-based GUI application for plotting and analyzing biomechanics data stored in Excel or CSV files.

## Usage

1. Install requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib scipy
   ```
2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python bio_graph_app.py
   ```

The original Jupyter notebook is provided as `アオキ編集中-完成.ipynb`. It was converted to the standalone script `bio_graph_app.py` for easier execution.
